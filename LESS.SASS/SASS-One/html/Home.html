                     CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it
                     work under the hood?
                     This
                     article explains what
                     CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
                     In the Introduction to HTML module we covered what HTML is, and how it is used to mark up
                     documents. These
                     documents
                     will be readable in a
                     web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line
                     and have space
                     between
                     them.
                     Links are colored
                     and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing is the
                     browser's default
                     styles —
                     very
                     basic styles that
                     the browser applies to HTML to make sure it will be basically readable even if no explicit
                     styling is specified
                     by
                     the
                     author of the page.
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <h4>What is <span class="rainbow">CSS</span> for?</h4>
                  <p>
                     As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to
                     users — how they
                     are
                     styled, laid out, etc.
                     A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most
                     common markup language,
                     but
                     you
                     may also come across
                     other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
                     Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience.
                     Browsers, like Firefox,
                     Chrome,
                     or Edge , are
                     designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or
                     printer.CSS can be used
                     for
                     very
                     basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links.
                     It can be used to
                     create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main
                     content area and a sidebar
                     for
                     related information. It
                     can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph
                     for specific
                     examples.

               <div>
                  <h4>Browser support information</h4>
                  <p>
                     Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or
                     more browsers have
                     implemented it. This means
                     that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that
                     can be output to the
                     screen.
                     We'll look at this
                     process more in the lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a
                     feature at the same
                     time,
                     and so
                     there is usually a
                     gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason,
                     being able to check
                     implementation status is
                     useful.
                     The browser support status is shown on every MDN property page in a section named "Browser
                     compatibility" (use
                     this
                     to
                     check if the property
                     can be used on your website). For example, the compatibility section for the CSS font-family
                     property is
                     reproduced
                     below.
